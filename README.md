# JS Todos Exercise

## To Do List exercise instructions and requirements

### Part 1

For this assignment you will be combining your knowledge of DOM access and events to build a todo app!

As a user, you should be able to:

    Add a new todo (by submitting a form)
    Mark a todo as completed (cross out the text of the todo)
    Remove a todo

### Part 2

Now that you have a functioning todo app, save your todos in localStorage! Make sure that when the page refreshes, the todos on the page remain there.

## Solution notes

This app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement a simple to do list, illustrating DOM manipulation and localstorage

Open the index.html file in a browser
